I am broadly interested in using geospatial data and machine learning for a wide range of applications. 
Some of the key topics I have worked on or continue to explore include:

Flood Mapping & Impact Assessment  
=====
- Global FLood Mapper

Urban Spatial Analysis  
=====
- Building Height Mapping: Estimating city-scale building heights from satellite images  
- Urban Growth Models: Simulating land-use change and urban expansion  
- Street Network Analysis: Extracting road hierarchy and connectivity using COINS  

Population & Socio-Economic Data Modeling  
=====
- Downscaling gridded population data for improved flood exposure estimates 

Predicting Deforestation & Land Cover Change  
=====
- Applying deep learning models to predict deforestation in the Amazon

## Open-Source Contributions  
I am passionate about open-source geospatial software development and have created tools to support 
research and real-world applications. Some of my notable projects include:  

- [PyRSGIS](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/pyrsgis) – A Python package for raster data processing, soon to include ML workflows for geospatial analysis  
- [Global Flood Mapper](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/global_flood_mapper) – A Google Earth Engine tool for rapid flood mapping  
- [COINS](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/COINS) – A Python-based tool for street network continuity analysis  

I am always looking to improve and expand these tools. If you're interested in collaboration or have ideas,
feel free to reach out!
