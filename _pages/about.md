Hi, Iâ€™m Pratyush Tripathy, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, 
Santa Barbara. My research focuses on integrating geospatial data, remote sensing, and machine learning 
to address critical environmental and societal challenges. I am particularly interested in using AI 
models to fill data gaps and enable large-scale analyses that are otherwise infeasible.

Over the years, I have worked on a range of geospatial and machine learning applications, including flood 
mapping, population modeling, and urban spatial analysis. My work aims to develop scalable, open-source 
tools that enhance accessibility and reproducibility in geospatial research.

For my doctoral work, I am investigating the impacts of extreme weather events on human and economic development in 
data-scarce regions and how satellite data and AI models can fill in gaps.
