Hi, Iâ€™m Pratyush Tripathy, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, 
Santa Barbara. My research focuses on integrating geospatial data and machine learning 
to investigate critical environmental and societal challenges. I am particularly interested in using AI 
models to fill data gaps and enable critical analyses that are otherwise infeasible.

Over the years, I have worked on a range of geospatial applications, including flood mapping using
satellite datasets, census data disaggregation, and urban  analysis. For my doctoral work, I am 
investigating the impacts of extreme weather events on human and economic development in  data-scarce
regions and how satellite data and AI models can help fill data gaps to present new insights.
