Hi, I'm **Pratyush Tripathy**, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, 
Santa Barbara. My interest lies in combining geospatial data and methods with machine learning and AI models
to fill critical data gaps and enable analyses that are otherwise not feasible.

In the past, I have developed novel methods for urban spatial analysis, including city-scale building height 
estimation from satellite images, urban growth models, population disaggregation, street network analysis, 
and spatial survey sampling techniques. My doctoral work investigates the impacts of extreme weather events 
on human and economic development in India.
