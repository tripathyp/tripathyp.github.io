I will be conducting a hands-on tutorial on "Flood mapping with optical and microwave satellite data: 
from indices to machine learning" at NeurIPS 2025 in San Diego. This tutorial is a part of the Climate Change AI's 
"[*Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning*](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2025)" track.

Details of the tutorial can be found [here](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2025/120).
