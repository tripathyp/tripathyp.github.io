I will be at NeurIPS 2025 in San Diego, CA to present my work on "Flood mapping with optical and microwave satellite data: 
from indices to machine learning". This is a part of the Climate Change AI's  *Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning* 
tutorial track. Please find the details here: [tripathyp.github.io/neurips2025](/neurips25.html).
